# Credit-risk-classification
Module 20
## Description:
By using the knowledge of Python and supervised learning (especially Logistic Regression), we will determine if the borrower is a healthy loan or a high-risk loan. In this challenge, I was able to import the necessary csv file, analyze it, split it in train and test, fit the model with and without oversampler data. 
 ## Installations
 I used pandas, numpy, and balanced_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report from sklearn.metrics
 ## Other Instructions:
 Every file can be found in the Credit_Risk folder.  Comments can be found above each code in jupyter notebook.

 ## Contributing
All the problems are solved with the help of the activities. Going throught the topics; logistic regression, confusion matrix and classification report has helped me finish this challenge.
